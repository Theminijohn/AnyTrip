# AnyTrip - v. 0.0.1

We are a Travel Company, hence we should travel more than 'mortal humans'. With the team growing MoM and YoY, tracking Flights and staying informed about a colleagues Trip becomes a funny task.

Let's say we are in a Magical World, where there is a Magical Application that keeps track of all of that :bowtie:.

## Flight Status & Track

Flight Status deals with questions such as:

- Is my flight on time?
- How long is the delay?
- Is it cancelled?
- What is my departure or arrival gate and terminal?
- What type of plane is used on this flight?

Flight Track consists of positional information/updates and answers questions such as:

- What is the planned flight path for this flight?
- Where is it now?
- Where has it been up to now?


## AnyTrip Score

Of course plain vanilla information is usefull, but not that fun right? Let's gamify it:
